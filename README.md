Named for
[Terry Pratchet's Sgt. Detritus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_Detritus),
this library consists of the bits and bats that I wish were in
clojure.core but arent. Most of what's in here is bats, and probably
little of it is polished enough for anyone else to use. You heard it
here first. As this is my personal bits and bats toolkit breaking
changes will be frequent and may or may not be changelogged. That
said, there may be some usefull bits in here so knock yourself out.
